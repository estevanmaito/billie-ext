# Billie Chrome Extension

If you are looking for the uncompressed code, see the main repo https://github.com/estevanmaito/billie

### If you want to test it:

âš  This is a WIP project and even though it works very well, the state of most websites breaks the extension turning it almost useless because of so many overlapping errors.

1. clone this repo
2. go to chrome://extensions/
3. enable Developer mode
4. click Load unpacked and select the extension folder

- if you parse a page and click over some highlighted area and nothing happens, just scroll down. It's probably a body/html problem and tooltips are rendered in the bottom of element.
